"Industry Return Predictability: A Machine Learning Approach" proposes a method for predicting industry returns based on the information in lagged industry returns from across the entire economy. First LASSO (choosing lambda using the corrected version of the Akaike information criterion) is used for feature selection. After this an OLS post-LASSO is performed and is used in future predictions. The dataset that the autors used in testing their results, contained 30 industry portfolios from 1960:01 to 2016:12.
